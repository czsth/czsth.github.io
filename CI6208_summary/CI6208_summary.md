## 01 - Introduction to Research

### Objectives

- To understand concepts, issues and techniques related to research for information professionals.
- To formulate clear research questions and identify an appropriate research design with the accompanying approach for data analysis.
- To carry out an empirical research project which is feasible and rigorous.



### Methods of Acquiring Knowledge

- Intuition  
  - Thinking that you know without reason
- Authority
  - Accepting from a highly respected source
- Rationalism
  - Using reasoning
- Empiricism
  - Using experience and observation



### Characteristics of Scientific Research

- Control
  - Influence of extraneous variables must be eliminated
  - Control condition is used to rule out the placebo effect
- Operationalism
  - Each concept must be defined by operations that measures it
- Replication
  - Results of a study must be reproducible in another study



### Roles of the Scientist

- Curiosity
  - Asking questions: What? When? Where? Why? How?
- Patience
  - Research involves a prolonged period of painstaking efforts
- Objectivity
  - Personal biases and opinions should be removed or minimized
- Change
  - Accepting change as part of the research process



### Objectives of Scientific Research
- Descriptive
  - Accurate portrayal of a situation or phenomenon
- Explanation
  - Knowledge of why a situation or phenomenon occurs
- Prediction
  - Anticipation of situation or phenomenon before it occurs
- Control
  - Manipulation of the conditions that lead to the situation or
  phenomenon



## 02 - Research Paradigms

### A Research Paradigm

- Definition
  - A set of beliefs about how research problems should be understood
  and addressed
  - Or simply a way of looking at a research issue
- Elements
  - Ontology: what is reality?
  - Epistemology: what is knowledge?
  - Methodology: what type of data is needed and why?
  - Method: what tools are most appropriate to collect data?



### Positivism

- Assumptions
  - Reality is context-free; Researchers are objective observers
  - Laws that govern social phenomenon can be formulated through
  scientific methods such as experimentation
- General focus
  - To uncover trends and patterns rather than on individuals
- Criticisms
  - Objective and scientific methods are appropriate for studying natural objects but less so for social phenomenon
  - Laws governing individuals and their relationships are complex



### Interpretivism

- Assumptions
  - Reality is dependent on our sense
  - Truth and reality are socially constructed
- General Focus
  - To gain insight into the lives of individuals and why they act they
  way they do
- Criticisms
  - It lacks objectivity
  - It does not yield generalizable theories



### Deductive Approach

- Purpose
  - To test a theory
- Emphasis
  - To confirm causality
- Sequence of Steps
  - Hypothesis → Observation → Confirmation
- Line of Reasoning
  - General principle → Special case



### Inductive Approach

- Purpose
  - To generate a new theory
- Emphasis
  - To explore a new phenomenon or to view from a new perspective
- Sequence of Steps
  - Observation → Finding patterns → Theory
- Line of Reasoning
  - Special case → General principle



### Quantitative Research

- Definition
  - The collection and analysis of large amount of quantifiable data to make predictions, establish causal relationships which are generalizable
- Variables
  - Independent variable (IV): the cause or predictor
  - Dependent variable (DV): the effect or outcome
  - Mediating variable: occurs between two variables in a causal chain
  - Moderating variable: specifies how relationship between two variables can change
    - Mediating variable is one step in the casual chain, while moderating variable is a weaker cause than an IV
  - Extraneous variable: not independent variables but could affect the results of the study
- Illustration
  - ![image-20211108140933107](./imgs/image-20211108140933107.png)



### Experimental Research

- Causation
  - Relationship: IV and DV must be related
  - Temporal order: changes in IV must precede changes in DV
  - No alternative explanation condition
- Characteristics
  - Objective observation: strive to ensure impartiality and freedom from biases
  - Manipulation:  deliberately changing the IV to trigger the outcome
  - Control: only variations are the experimental conditions



### Experimental Research Pro & Cons

- Advantages
  - The best method to identify causal relationships
  - Researcher is able to manipulate one or more IV
  - Researcher has control over extraneous variables
- Disadvantages
  - Cannot test non-manipulated variables
  - The experimental setting is artificial
  - Inadequate because humans are not manipulable mechanistic
  objects



### Experimental Research Forms

- Field experiment
  - Conducted in a real-life setting
  - E.g. To find out if a customer’s attire affects the time it takes to receive attention from the sales assistant in a store
- Laboratory experiment
  - Conducted in a laboratory where extraneous variables can be controlled
- Internet experiment
  - Conducted over the internet
  - E.g. To compare variables influencing the perception of female attractiveness conducted over the Internet and in the controlled conditions of a laboratory



### Non-experimental Quantitative Research
- Definition
  - Quantitative research which does not involve any manipulation of the independent variable
- Forms
  - Correlational study: measuring two variables and their relationship (could be confounded by the “third variable problem”; for more complex relationships, path analysis could be used to identify direct and indirect effects)
  - Natural manipulation research: the IV could be described as a contrast between treatment and control condition. (e.g. to investigate the relationship between divorce and psychological functioning of adults)
  - Cross-sectional study: conducted at a single time period
  - Longitudinal study: collecting data over a period of time



### Qualitative Research

- Definition
  - The collection and analysis of multiple types of subjective data to investigate a phenomenon in its natural setting
- Characteristics
  - Interpretive: seek to understand the insider’s view
  - Triangulation: use multiple data sources and methods to cross-check
  - Natural setting: to gain an empathic understanding of the phenomenon
- Strengths and weaknesses
  - Deeper understanding of a phenomenon
  - Supports logic of discovery
  - Results may not be generalizable



### Methods of Data Collection

- Tests
  - Designed to measure personality, achievements and performance
  - Strengths include supporting comparability across research populations and facilitating data analysis
  - Weaknesses include high costs and potential biases to some groups of people
- Questionnaires
  - Self-reported instruments to capture opinions and perceptions
  - Strengths include low cost and ease of data analysis
  - Weaknesses include potentially low response rate and the need for validation

- Interviews
  - Interviewees are asked a series of questions
  - Strengths include the possibility of probing further and uncovering in-depth information
  - Weaknesses include reactive effect (interviews showing social desirability bias) and investigator effect (interviewers showing biases and poor interviewing skills)
- Focus Groups
  - Interviews conducted with a small and homogenous group
  - Strengths include exploration of ideas and concepts
  - Weaknesses include high cost and the possibility being dominated by a few participants

- Observations
  - Naturalistic observation: done in a real-world setting
  - Laboratory observation: done in a controlled environment
  - Time-interval sampling: observe at preselected time interval
  - Event sampling:  observe each time an event occurs
  - Level of involvement: Complete observer, observer-as-participant, participant-as-observer, complete participant
- Existing or Secondary Data
  - Documents: written for private purposes
  - Physical data: materials created or left behind that are of interest
  - Archived research data: collected by other researchers

## 03 - Formulating Research Questions

### Sources of Research Ideas

- Everyday life
  - Questions arise from interpersonal interactions and experiences
- Practical Issues
  - Issues in workplace and society demand answers
- Theory
  - An existing theory can be tested in an entirely new context
- Past Research
  - Research conducted previously can inspire new ideas



### Non-researchable Ideas

- No possibility of empirical investigation
  - Issues on morality and religion are outside the scope of scientific inquiry (e.g. Does God exist?)
  - Philosophical questions that cannot be subjected to empirical analysis (e.g. Are humans born good or evil?)
  - Rhetorical questions that do not expect an answer (e.g. How can we live without love?)



### Review of Literature

- Purpose
  - To know the extent to which the problem has been addressed
  - To be informed in the choice of research design
  - To be aware of the methodological challenges
  - To identify the need for special equipment
- Resources
  - Journal articles
  - Conference papers
  - Books
  - Internet sources



### Research Problem & Purpose

- Grounded in theory or prior research
  - Ideally relies on a theory or prior research as its starting point
- Addresses one or more research gaps
  - Seeks to fill the gap(s) where current understanding is lacking
- Holds theoretical and practical significance
  - Makes a meaningful contribution to theory and practice
- Generates research questions
  - It is expressible as questions to facilitate scientific inquiry



### Quantitative Research Question

- Builds on and adds to past research
  - Serves to extend what has been done previously
  - Adds to knowledge and bears practical implications
- Specific and clear
  - Expresses key ideas specifically and clearly
- Empirically verifiable
  - Responses to the question must be verifiable
- Feasible
  - The question can be addressed within a reasonable time-frame



### Bad Research Questions

- Broadly framed questions
  - Broadly framed question on an ill-defined issue cannot be systematically addressed
  - E.g. Are smartphones bad for schools?
- How-to questions
  - Questions that involve step-by-step procedures are not research-related
  - E.g. How to fix a punctured tire?
- Questions with trivial answers
  - Questions involving counting or listing are not research-worthy
  - E.g. What many student have been enrolled in the University in 2020?



### Hypothesis

- Definition
  - Statement about the relationship between two or more variables which can be tested
  - Must be capable of being rejected or confirmed
- Basis
  - Formulated based on observation, informed reasoning and past research
- Research and Null Hypotheses
  - Research hypothesis: an assertion about the relationship among variables
  - Null hypothesis: a statement about the non-relationship among the variables
    - Null hypothesis (H0) is the currently accepted hypothesis, and what to do is trying to reject it by proving it is false, or its negative proposition (H1) is true.



### Correlation vs Causation

- Correlation
  - The extension to which two variables are linearly related
  - E.g. “Ice-cream sales is correlated to incidents of sunburn”
- Causation
  - An indication of an event causing an outcome
  - E.g. “Smoking causes lung cancer”
  - Test for causation: 
    1. covariation,
    2. temporal precedence,
    3. relationship is nonspurious (not caused by a third variable).



### Qualitative Research Question

- A central question followed by sub-questions
  - Focuses on a single phenomenon or concept
  - Uses open-ended questions such as “how” and “why”
  - Specifies the participants and the research site
- Example
  - What are the experiences of working adults who enrolled in a full-time master’s program in an autonomous university in Singapore?
    - Why do working adults decide to enroll in a full-time masters’ program?
    - How do these adults describe their re-entry experiences?
    - How does returning to the university change the lives of these adults?



## 04 - Measurement and Sampling

### Measurement

- Construct
  - Sometimes known as concept or variable
  - A generalized idea about a class of objects, attributes
- Operationalization
  - The way a variable is represented and measured
  - Typically grounded in the literature
- Scales of measurement
  - Nominal scale: identifies types or groups (e.g. gender)
  - Ordinal scale: rank-order (distance between ranks unknown)
  - Interval scale: equal distance between adjacent numbers on the scale
  - Ratio scale: has rank order, equal intervals and an absolute zero



### Criteria for Good Measurement

- Reliability
  - The degree to which the measure is error-free and yields consistent results
- Validity
  - The degree to which the measure actually measures what it is intended
- Sensitivity
  - The degree to which the measure can accurately measure the variability in stimuli or responses.



### Reliability

- Test-retest reliability
  - Same results are obtained from a test repeatedly done over time
- Equivalent-forms reliability
  - Same results are obtained from two equivalent tests
- Internal consistency reliability
  - Same results are obtained from different items measuring a variable
  - Cronbach’s alpha is used commonly to confirm internal consistency
- Inter-rater reliability
  - Same results are obtained from different assessors or observes of the same event



### Validity
- Definitions
  - Simple: How accurately a test measures what it seeks to measure
  - Contemporary: the degree to which evidence and theory support the interpretation of test scores entailed by its proposed use
- Implications
  - The test itself is neither valid nor invalid.  Validity concerns the interpretation and uses of the scores
  - Validity is a matter of degree
  - Based on evidence and theory



### Content-related Validity
- Definition
  - The extent to which the test adequately represents the target domain
- Face validity
  - Does not mean the test really measures what was intended; it only appears to be so for the respondents
  - Crude and basic measure of validity
- Homogeneity
  - The degree to which a set of items in a test measures a single construct
  - Can be checked using item-to-total correlation and coefficient alpha



### Criterion-related Validity
- Definition
  - The degree to which scores from a test correlate well with those of other tests
- Predictive validity
  - The degree to which scores from a test can predict a construct measured by another test at a later time (e.g. high scorers of a test at age 12 were found to obtain good grades from the University)
- Concurrent validity
  - The degree to which scores from a test can predict a construct measured by another validated test (e.g. comparability of scores between a new IQ test and an existing IQ test)

- Convergent validity
  - The degree to which scores from a test correlate with scores from other tests of the same construct (e.g. a survey and participant observation are used to measure depression, the scores arising from both are correlated).
- Discriminant validity
  - The degree to which scores from a test is unrelated to the scores of another test measuring a different construct (e.g. scores from a honesty test do not correlate with scores from an intelligence test)
  - Important to include convergent tests to compare against discriminant tests
  - Known-group validity: the degree to which a test is sensitive to the differences between two groups



### Reliability vs Validity

![image-20211109100859428](./imgs/image-20211109100859428.png)



### Types of Research Validity
- Statistical conclusion validity
  - It is the validity of the claim that the IV and DV covary
- Construct validity
  - The degree to which scores on a test adequately measure the construct they are intended to measure
- Internal validity
  - The degree to which DV are attributable to the IV but not other confounding, extraneous variables
- External validity
  - The degree to which results from the study are generalizable beyond the study



### Threats to Construct Validity
- Participant reactivity to the experiment
  - Demand characteristics: participants’ tendencies to respond in a way which they thought was expected of them
  - Positive self-presentation: participants’ tendencies to respond in a way which makes them appear most positive (social desirability bias)
- Experimenter Effects
  - Experimenter expectancies: expectations which cause the experimenter to subconsciously influence the participants
  - Experimenter attributes: 
    - (1) biosocial: experimenter’s age, race, gender; 
    - (2) psychosocial: anxiety level, hostility, authoritarian; 
    - (3) situational factors: whether there was prior experimenter-participant contact



### Threats to Internal Validity
- History
  - An event that affects the outcome other than the treatment
  - Differential history occurs when one group experiences the history event while the other group does not
- Maturation
  - Changes to the individual including aging, learning, fatigue, boredom during the course of the study
- Attrition
  - The loss of participants because they have dropped out
  - Differential attrition occurs when there is a disproportionate loss of participants across groups

- Selection
  - Non-equivalence among groups due to the use of different selection procedures
- Testing
  - Changes in the scores participant obtain when doing the same test a second time
- Regression artifacts
  - Effects that appear to be due to the treatment but are actually due to the natural movement towards the mean
  - Selecting participants with extreme scores could lead to this effect

- Instrumentation
  - Changes that occur over time in the measurement of the DV (e.g. using human observers can lead to instrumentation error)
- Addictive and interactive effects
  - Different threats to internal validity can combine to produce complex biases (e.g. selection-history effect:  groups composed of different kinds of people who respond differently to the same history)



### External Validity
- Population validity
  - The ability to generalize beyond the sample in the study to the entire target population
- Ecological validity
  - The ability to generalize the findings across different environmental conditions
- Temporal validity
  - The ability to generalize the findings across time
  - Seasonal variation: occurs when value of DV varies with season
  - Cyclical variation: refers to systematic up-and-down movement of DV over time

- Treatment variation validity
  - The ability to generalize the results across variations of the treatment (e.g. different level of competencies of experimenter in cognitive- behavior therapy may affect treatment variation validity)
- Outcome validity
  - The ability to generalize the findings across different but related DVs (e.g. a job-training program which helps trainees get a job but not hold on the job does not have outcome validity)



### Internal vs External Validity
- Inverse relationship
  - When external validity is increased, internal validity is reduced and vice versa
  - Important to consider the purpose of the research to determine if internal or external validity is of primary importance



### Terminology in Sampling
- Sample
  - A set of elements from the population (subset of the population)
- Population
  - Full set of elements or people from which you are studying
- Representative Sampling
  - A sample that resembles the population
- Sampling Error
  - Differences between sample values and true population parameter



### Random Sampling Techniques
- Simple Random Sampling
  - A basic equal probability of selection method (EPSEM)
- Stratified Random Sampling
  - Divide the population into mutually exclusive groups and then select a random sample from each group
  - Proportional stratified sampling: sample proportions are made the same as the population proportion on the stratification variable
  - Disproportional stratified sampling: sample proportions are different from the population proportion on the stratification variable

- Cluster Random Sampling
  - A sampling method where clusters (usually naturally occurring groups) are randomly selected
  - One-stage cluster sampling: all individuals in selected clusters are sampled
  - Two-stage cluster sampling:  (1) randomly select a sample of clusters (2) randomly select individuals from these clusters
- Systematic Sampling
  - Determine the sampling interval, k (population divided by sample size)
  - Randomly select a number between 1 and k; include this individual
  - Include every kth from the population in the sample
  - Periodicity:  a problem which occurs if there is a cyclical pattern in the sample frame



### Nonrandom Sampling Techniques
- Convenience Sampling
  - Selecting individuals who are readily available
- Quota Sampling
  - Set quotas and then use convenience sampling to meet the quotas
- Purposive Sampling
  - Specifies the characteristics of the population of interest, and then select individuals who fulfill the characteristics
- Snowball Sampling
  - Each sampled individual recommend another person with the inclusion characteristic(s)



### Random Selection vs Assignment
- Random Selection
  - To obtain a representative sample
- Random Assignment
  - To produce two or more probabilistically equivalent groups for an experimen



### Sample Size
- Guidelines in determining the sample size
  - If the population is < 100, do a census
  - Refer to the literature on similar research
  - Use a sample size calculator
- A large sample size is needed
  - When the population is heterogenous
  - When data need to be broken into multiple dimensions for analysis
  - When high precision is needed
  - When weak relationship or small effect is expected
  - When a less efficient sampling technique is used



### Sampling in Qualitative Research
- Maximum variation sampling
  - Selecting wide ranges of cases
- Extreme case sampling
  - Selecting cases from both ends of the spectrum of interest
- Homogenous case selection
  - Selecting a small set of homogeneous cases
- Typical-case selection
  - Selecting cases believed to be typical or average

- Critical-case sampling
  - Selecting cases known to be very important
- Negative-case sampling
  - Selecting cases believed to be disconfirmatory
- Opportunistic sampling
  - Selecting a case when the opportunity arises
- Mixed sampling
  - Mixing qualitative and quantitative sampling techniques



## 05 - Survey Research

### Introduction to Survey Research

  - Check for content and construct validity
  - Rely on the literature to establish construct validity
- Ensure items are appropriate for respondents
  - Consider reading level, demographic and cultural characteristics of respondents
  - Consider a pilot study to ensure comprehensibility of every item

- Ensure each item is short and simple
  - Each item must be short, simple and precise. Avoid jargons
- Avoid loaded or leading questions
  - A loaded question triggers positive or negative emotions (e.g. to what extent will you consume this medicine with a pungent taste?)
  - A leading question suggests how the response should be made (e.g. to what extent are you inclined to cheat on your spouse?)

- Avoid double-barreled question
  - A double-barrel question contains more than one issue
- Avoid double negatives
  - A double negative is a sentence with two negatives

- Decide whether question is open-ended or closed-ended
  - An open-ended question allows responses in natural language
  - A close-ended question limits responses to a predefined set
- Close-ended Qn: mutually exclusive and exhaustive
  - Response categories must (i) not overlap (ii) cover the whole range of possibilities

- Close-ended Qn: use appropriate rating scales
  - Use a multichotomous format: e.g. 5-point scale
- Use multiple items to measure a complex construct
  - Score is derived by adding item scores on a multi-point Likert Scale
- Ensure questionnaire is easy to use
  - Keep questionnaire short to minimize respondent fatigue
  - Minimise social desirability bias, and response set
- Pilot the questionnaire
  - Identify respondents similar to target respondents for pilot testing



## 06 - Experimental Research

### Between- & Within-Participants Designs
- Pre-test-post-test control-group design
  - Administer pre-test and post-test to randomly assigned experimental and control groups
  - Ceiling effect: scores on DV are so high they cannot increase from pre-test to post-test
  - Floor effect: scores on DV are so low they cannot decrease from pre- test to post-test
  - Use ANCOVA to control for pre-test difference between the groups



### Factorial Designs

![image-20211109110645408](./imgs/image-20211109110645408.png)

![image-20211109110743141](./imgs/image-20211109110743141.png)

![image-20211109111101729](./imgs/image-20211109111101729.png)

- Strengths
  - Able to manipulate more than one IV simultaneously
  - Able to control confounding variable by including it as an IV
  - Able to study interaction effects on DV
- Weaknesses
  - Number of participants increases with more IV to be tested
  - Difficult to manipulate more than two IV simultaneously
  - High-order interaction effects (e.g. 3-way interaction) are hard to interpret



### Control Techniques At the Start
- Randomization
  - Designed to ensure all comparison groups are equal on all extraneous variables
  - Eliminates systematic bias in the experiment
- Matching
  - Holding variables constant: specify the inclusion criterion for participants (e.g. only females are selected for experiment)
  - Building extraneous variables into research design:  using “blocking”, divide participants into subgroups based on the extraneous variable (e.g. Low IQ scores vs Mid IQ scores vs High IQ scores), IV is created
  - Yoked control :  experimental subject receives response-dependent outcome but control subject receives response-independent outcome
  - Individual matching: subjects are matched on the variables to be controlled (e.g. based on gender, age, IQ).  No new IV is created.



### Counterbalancing
- Introduction
  - Systematic variation of order of experimental conditions in repeated measure design
  - Helps to control sequencing effects: 
    - (1) order effect (error due to the order of conditions), and
    - (2) carryover effect (lingering effects of a previous experimental condition on a current one)

- Randomized counterbalancing
  - Sequence order is randomized for each participant
- Intrasubject counterbalancing
  - Each participant take treatment condition in one order, and then in the reverse order (e.g. in 3-condition design: ABCCBA)
- Complete counterbalancing
  - Identify all possible sequences and then randomly assign subgroups to each sequence (e.g. 1:ABC; 2:ACB; 3: BAC; 4: BCA; 5:CAB; 6:CBA)
- Incomplete counterbalancing
  - Identify fewer than all possible sequences and then randomly assign subgroups to each sequence



### Minimizing Participants Effects
- Double-blind placebo method
  - Both experimenter and participants are unaware which group receives the treatment condition
- Deception
  - Provide false information to all participants about what is being done to control for differential perceptions about the purpose of the study (e.g. Milgram Experiment)
- Insights into participants’ perceptions
  - Retrospective verbal report: asking participants major aspects of the study at the end
  - Concurrent verbal report: (i) sacrifice groups: stopped and interviewed; (ii) concurrent probing: asking during the study; (iii) think- aloud technique: participants verbalize their thoughts and perceptions



### Minimizing Experimenter Effects

- Control of recording errors
  - Use multiple human data recorders; automate data recording
- Control of experimenter attribute errors
  - Avoiding using one experimenter in one condition, and a different experimenter in another condition
- Control of experimenter expectancy error
  - Blind technique: experimenter is completely unaware which group receives treatment
  - Partial blind technique: experimenter is partially aware of the details of the study
  - Automation: reduces or eliminates participant-experimenter interaction



### Participants Recruitment
- Power
  - The probability of rejecting a false-null hypothesis
  - Power increases as the number of participants increases
  - Desirable for the power to be high (ie. At least .80)
- Effect size
  - Magnitude of the relation between IV and DV
- Sample size
  - Number of participants needed
- Alpha level
  - Usually used at 0.05



### Pilot Study
- Definition
  - Run-through of the experiment with a small number of participants
- Purposes
  - Helps indicate whether IV manipulated produced the expected effect
  - Gives researcher the experience with the procedure
  - Identifies subtle factors that can influence the experiment



## 07 - Observational Research

### Qualitative Research Characteristics
- Design strategies
  - Naturalistic inquiry: studying real-world situations; non-manipulative and non-controlling
  - Emergent design flexibility: openness to adapting inquiry as understanding deepens and/or situations change
  - Purposeful sampling: cases are chosen to gain insights into phenomenon, not empirical generalization

- Data-collection and fieldwork strategies
  - Qualitative data: thick description, direct quotes about from people about their perspectives and experiences
  - Personal experience and engagement: researcher has direct contact with the people
  - Empathic neutrality and mindfulness: researcher is empathic and does not pass judgement
  - Dynamic systems: assumes change as an ongoing phenomenon, and thus attentive to system and situation dynamics

- Analysis strategies
  - Unique case orientation: assumes each case to be unique
  - Inductive analysis and creative synthesis: immersion in the details of the data to uncover patterns, themes and relationships; ends with a creative synthesis
  - Holistic perspective: whole phenomenon understand as a complex system; focus on complex interdependencies
  - Context sensitivity: Findings are placed within a unique social, historical and temporal context
  - Voice, perspective and reflexivity: researcher seeks to be balanced in depicting the phenomenon authentically while being self-analytical and politically aware and reflexive



### Qualitative Research Validity
- Descriptive validity
  - Account reported is accurate and factual
  - Employ researcher triangulation to obtain descriptive validity
- Interpretive validity

  - Theory or explanation fits the data
  - Carry out extended fieldwork (longer time period); triangulate with multiple theories to interpret the data; pattern-matching by testing hypothesis; checking with peers

- Internal validity
  - Focus is on idiographic causation (involving a particular case), rather than nomological causation (relationships among variables)
  - Researcher-as-detective;  methods triangulation; data triangulation
- External validity
  - Focus is on naturalistic generalization
  - Need to include contextual details to enable naturalistic generalization
  - Ultimate goal is to strive for theoretical generalization (main ideas and process observed might be generalized)
